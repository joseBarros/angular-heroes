  //When the given name is non-blank, the handler creates a Hero-like object from the name (it's only missing the id) and passes it to the services addHero() method.

  // The component's delete() method immediately removes the hero-to-delete from that list, anticipating that the HeroService will succeed on the server.
  // There's really nothing for the component to do with the Observable returned by heroService.delete(). It must subscribe anyway.
  // If you neglect to subscribe(), the service will not send the delete request to the server! As a rule, an Observable does nothing until something subscribes!

  // Reserve the constructor for simple initialization such as wiring constructor parameters to properties.

  // The component's ngOnInit lifecycle hook calls the HeroService method, not the constructor.

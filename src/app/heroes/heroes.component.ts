  // This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.

  // Reserve the constructor for simple initialization such as wiring constructor parameters to properties.
  // While you could call getHeroes() in the constructor, that's not the best practice.
  // Angular will inject the singleton HeroService into that property when it creates the HeroesComponent.
  // The HeroService injected into a component is created with another injected service, MessageService.

  // Instead, call getHeroes() inside the ngOnInit lifecycle hook and let Angular call ngOnInit at an appropriate time after constructing a HeroesComponent instance.
  // The component's ngOnInit lifecycle hook calls the HeroService method, not the constructor.
